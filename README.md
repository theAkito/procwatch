## What
Uses the `/proc` pseudo-filesystem, to notify of completed Linux processes.

## Why
Compiling Gentoo or compiling Linux on a Raspberry Pi 0 W can take days.
If you do not want to check, when the compilation has finally finished, but instead be automatically notified on completion, this is the app for you.

## How
If you want to build the project yourself, you need `libssl` and `libdbus` development libraries.

Example installation for Debian based distributions:
```bash
apt install -y libdbus-1-dev libssl-dev
```

Send an e-mail, when process with the PID `314` exits.

```bash
procwatch --pid=314 --to=mail@boom.me
```

Watch all processes of the name `appy`. Dispatch a desktop notification, instead of an e-mail.

```bash
procwatch --notify appy
```

For more advanced possibilities, check the `help` on the command line.

```bash
procwatch --help
```

## Where
For now, you can download pre-compiled binaries in the Releases section of this repository.
It is planned to package this properly, once it has reached a rather stable state.

Runs on Linux, what else?

## Goals
* Reliability
* Get process watching done. Do not overload with unnecessary features.

## Project Status
Before Pre-Alpha. Unstable API. Model for config JSON will change a lot.

## TODO
* ~~Add Configuration File.~~
* ~~Add multiple E-Mail recipients support.~~
* ~~Add Mattermost support.~~
* ~~Add Matrix support.~~
* ~~Add Rocket.Chat support.~~
* Reach Stability.
