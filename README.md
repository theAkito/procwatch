## What
Uses the `/proc` pseudo-filesystem, to notify of completed Linux processes.

## Why
Compiling Gentoo or compiling Linux on a Raspberry Pi 0 W can take days.
If you do not want to check, when the compilation has finally finished, but instead be automatically notified on completion, this is the app for you.

## How
If you want to build the project yourself, you need `libssl` and `libdbus` development libraries.

Example installation for Debian based distributions:
```bash
apt install -y libdbus-1-dev libssl-dev
```

### Docker
```bash
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" --volume "/proc:/data/proc" --volume "./procwatch/config:/data/config" -it akito13/procwatch 1234 # Replace `1234` with the PID you are watching.
```

For usage information, check out the [Usage Guide](https://github.com/theAkito/procwatch/wiki/Usage-Guide).

## Where
For now, you can download pre-compiled binaries in the Releases section of this repository.
It is planned to package this properly, once it has reached a rather stable state.

Runs on Linux, what else?

## Goals
* Reliability
* Get process watching done. Do not overload with unnecessary features.

## Project Status
